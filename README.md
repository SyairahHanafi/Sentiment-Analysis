Sentiment Analysis on Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse Movie

This project performs sentiment analysis on audience reviews of the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse as a purpose of university project. The goal is to determine whether public opinions from platform IMdb toward the movie are positive, negative, or neutral, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The notebook processes real user review data, applies text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification models to analyze overall audience sentiment.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Cleaned and preprocessed raw text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
Trained ML models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Visualized sentiment distribution and model performance.

üß© Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK / TextBlob
Matplotlib / Seaborn

üìä Results
The best performing model achieved high accuracy in classifying review sentiments.
Most user reviews reflected positive sentiment, aligning with the film‚Äôs critical acclaim.

Future Improvements
Integrate a deep learning model (LSTM/BERT) for improved contextual understanding.
Expand the dataset with reviews from multiple platforms (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Twitter).
Build a web dashboard for visualizing real-time sentiment trends.
